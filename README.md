in this project i used serial communication with esp8266 module to extract and use the gyroscopic data as game input. 
Steps:
1.Connect esp 8266 node mcu as:
  D1 - SCL
  D2 - SDA 
  and connect the power accordingly.
2.Upload arduino code and press ctr-shift-M to open serial monitor and check if the mpu6050 is giving correct values.
3.Now you can adjust the sensitivity and different stuff from the code itself.
4.Download all the required NuGet libraries and run the c# code in any supported ide.


I will be making a UI for this porject as it has helped me learn alot about serial communication and how microcontrollers work.
